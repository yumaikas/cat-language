# Side Effects #

A side effect is an effect or consequence arising from the evaluation of a [function](Function.md) or [expression](Expression.md) that is different from the values popped from or pushed on to the stack.

Some examples of side-effects are:

  * Writing something to a file
  * Creating a directory
  * Printing a message to the console
  * Displaying a graphical element
  * Sending a mild electric shock to someone

A function or expression with no side-effects is called [pure](Purity.md) and a function or expression with side-effects is called [impure](Purity.md).
