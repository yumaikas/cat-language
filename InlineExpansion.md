# Inline Expansion #

Inline expansion is an [optimization technique](Optimization.md) that replaces function calls with function bodies. This can be done for a quotation using `#i` or `#i0` [meta-command](MetaCommand.md). The `#i` performs up to 5 passes and the `#i0` meta-command performs a single pass.
