# Support for Cat #

If you need help using Cat on a project, we encourage you to use the [discussion forum](http://groups.google.com/group/catlanguage). If you have identified a bug with the Cat interpreter, or want to make a feature request you can also report it using the [issue reporting form](http://code.google.com/p/cat-language/issues/list).

If you are planning on using Cat for a large commercial project, and need extended support [Christopher Diggins](ChristopherDiggins.md), the designer of Cat, is available for consulting.
