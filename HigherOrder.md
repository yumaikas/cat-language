# Higher Order Functions #

Higher-order functions are functions that either take a function as an argument or return a function as a result.

The primitive higher-order functions that return new functions in Cat are [quote](Quote.md) and [compose](Compose.md). These can be used in conjunction with the [stack shuffling functions](Shufflers.md) to create any other function.

Higher-order functions which accept one or more functions as arguments are often referred to as [combinators](Combinators.md). The primitive combinators are [eval](Eval.md) and [dip](Dip.md).
