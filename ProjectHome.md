The [Cat](Cat.md) programming language is a functional stack-based programming language, with an optional static type-system. Think Forth meets Haskell. Cat is heavily inspired by the [Joy](Joy.md) programming language.

The main project is the C# source code for an interpreter of the Cat language maintained by the language designer [Christopher Diggins](http://www.cdiggins.com). You can view the source code online at http://cat-language.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/.

The Cat interpreter is tested primarily on Windows but should also run on Linux and Mac using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).
